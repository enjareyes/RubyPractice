Chris Pine - Chap 10 
(using recursion)

Your sorting algorithm is good for general-purpose sorting, 
but when you sort strings, you are using the ordering of the 
characters in your fonts (called the ASCII codes) rather than true 
dictionary ordering. In a dictionary, case (upper or lower) is 
irrelevant to the ordering. So, make a new method to sort words 
(something like dictionary_sort). Remember, though, that if I give 
your program words starting with capital letters, it should return 
words with those same capital letters, just ordered as youâ€™d find 
in a dictionary.

A < Z < a < z 

Capital letters have a smaller ASCII value than the lowercase
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

words_array = ["Apple", "apple", "Bob", "baby", "zebra", "Baby", "YOYO"]

def dictionary_sort(unsorted_array, sorted_array=[])


	if unsorted_array == []
	puts sorted_array
	return sorted_array
	end

	new_unsorted = []
	current_smallest = unsorted_array.pop

	unsorted_array.each do |word|
		if word.downcase < current_smallest.downcase
			new_unsorted << current_smallest
			current_smallest = word
		elsif word.downcase == current_smallest.downcase
			if word > current_smallest
				new_unsorted << word
			else
				new_unsorted << current_smallest
				current_smallest = word
			end
		else # word.downcase > current_smallest.downcase
			new_unsorted << word
		end


	end # end of each loop
	
	sorted_array << current_smallest
	unsorted_array = new_unsorted
	dictionary_sort(new_unsorted, sorted_array)

end

dictionary_sort(words_array)
